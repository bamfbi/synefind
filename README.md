## importing

Literally the only thing that is possible as of now, other than the JUCE related stuff that I don't really understand. <br> 
To run and import, run `python setup.py develop`, which will set the module up for importing. Then navigate to your most favoritist python3 environment and smash an `import synefind`.  <br> 
You will be greeted by a lovely init message.
